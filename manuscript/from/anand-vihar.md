**Tell-you-what!**
Anand Vihar Railway Station, Anand Vihar ISBT and the metro station are just a walk apart. [The Metro](#metro) will be the cheapest and the fastest form of transport, but it will take you at least an hour!

* Buy your tickets directly for Hauz Khas(On the Yellow Line).
* Take the metro at Anand Vihar(On the blue line) directed towards Dwarka.
* Alight at Rajiv Chowk and remember you **DO NOT NEED TO EXIT** the Rajiv Chowk Station when changing from the blue line to the yellow line.
* Take the Yellow Line till Hauz Khas.
* For this route, metro may not be the best mode of transportation because of the unnecessary extra travel distance and time.
 
There is no direct bus either. However, you can take 543, 543A or any other bus going towards Dhaula Kuan or Nehru Place (there are many such buses running at high frequency, so you’re likely to get one within 2 minutes). After that, you need to get into 507 by changing at Lajpat Nagar bus stand (or the next stop, South Ex bus stand). You’re likely to catch this bus within 10-15 minutes. 507 will drop you directly at IIT Gate. This will cost a total of 20 rupees per person (around 40 in case of AC buses). Alternatively, you can go directly to Nehru Place (via 543 or 543A) and take a 764 to IIT Gate. This route will be slightly longer, but the frequency of 764 is quite high that tallies it out.

Taking a taxi or an auto is much more expensive but the most convenient! But taxis may not be as easy to find as the auto. Autorickshaws are easily available outside the station/bus stand. The approximate distance from Anand Vihar to IIT Delhi is 25 kms (depending on the route the auto driver decides to take). The fare breakup of Autos and Taxis is given below.
