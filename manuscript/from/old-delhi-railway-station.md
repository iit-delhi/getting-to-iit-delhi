## From Delhi Junction / Old Delhi Railway Station (DLI)

* **Nearest metro station** - Chandni Chowk
Just hop onto the yellow line from the Chandni Chowk Metro station( walkable distance from the station) and hop off straight at Hauz Khas. This trip should just cost you &#8377; 18, and an additional &#8377; 10 - &#8377; 30 depending on whether you take a shared, or an individual auto from Hauz Khas to your hostels.  

* **Nearest bus terminal** - ISBT Kashmere Gate
A direct bus from the ISBT to IIT is not available. However, if you must travel by bus, find the various indirect route options from [here](http://www.delhitravelhelp.in)
We would advise you against changing buses while carrying a huge baggage as it could be quite difficult with risk of injuries and losing your luggage.

* **Autos/taxis** - Easily available outside
  * An auto will cost you  around &#8377; 140 - &#8377; 160 (At night this will go up to &#8377; 170 - &#8377; 190).
  * A taxi will make your pocket lighter by &#8377; 235 - &#8377; 250 ( Make this &#8377; 300 at night)

**Tell-you-what!**
If arriving at a non-peak hour, you should preferably [take the Metro](#metro). You can also use the Metro during peak travel hours, but be prepared for some dhakka-mukki especially at the infamous Rajiv Chowk and at Central Secretariat, both of which fall on the way. If unsure however, you can always take an auto/taxi.
