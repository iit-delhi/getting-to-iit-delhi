####Fares from New Delhi Railway Station
* **Via Metro** - &#8377; 16 if you buy a token. Using the smart card will give you a 10% discount though it requires a first time payment of &#8377; 100. It includes a security of &#8377; 50 which you’ll get back when you return the card. 
* **Via Bus** - Bus 505 will cost &#8377; 20. Taking the other two routes will cost you &#8377; 20-30 depending on whether you take DTC’s GreenLine bus(non AC) or RedLine bus (AC).
* **Via taxi** - Taxis charge you &#8377; 25 for the first km and &#8377; 14 for each subsequent km. So be ready to shell out a couple of hundred notes for a taxi ride to IIT.
* **Via auto** - Autos are comparatively cheaper. The meter will probably stop between &#8377; 110-120 when you reach. Though the auto-vallas would say otherwise and insist on going by prepaid at &#8377; 150, stick by the meter.
