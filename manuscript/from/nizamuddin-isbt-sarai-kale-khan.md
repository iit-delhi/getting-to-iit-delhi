**Tell-you-what!**
The Station and the ISBT are at a walking distance from each other. While the Nizamuddin Station is only about 12-13 km from IIT, same as NDLS, the connecting public transport is poor, with no metro line at the station. Therefore, if possible, avoid travelling by a train which arrives at HZNS or a bus that arrives at Sarai Kale Khan. If you have already booked your tickets or cannot avoid the station, it is best to take a direct Auto/Taxi to IIT. There is no direct bus to IIT from Hazrat Nizamuddin.
You can take DTC Bus No. 101 from Hazrat Nizamuddin to ISBT (In case you want to skip 3km walk). Then DTC Bus No. 622 from ISBT to IIT gate. [http://www.delhitravelhelp.in]
Or you can take Bus No. 711/543A/534 till South Ex/Lajpat Nagar and then catch 507.
