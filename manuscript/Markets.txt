* **What to buy**  
 The famous Connaught place Market offers you everything you can ask from. Clothes, Electronics, Booksâ€¦ you name it and CP has it.

  Janpath is an excellent market if you are looking for some trendy clothes. All types of clothing are available at pretty affordable prices. The latest fashion wear from across the world reach Janpath before any other market
The Palika Bazaar is an underground market, situated under the Central Park. The hub for all kind of pirated items, from Video CDs to Deodorants to even branded clothes. Jerseys of famous sporting teams available here at throwaway prices. A lot of funky goods are also available

  **Tip** - Although it has a lot to offer, it has its share of thugs as well. Keep a good eye so that you are not duped into buying fake goods and end up cursing us!!!

  There is plenty of scope to bargain in here. For those who are not good at this, quote about half of what the vendor offers, stand there with a cool and confident expression(as if you have been buying such stuff for years) or even walk away(it adds to the effect). Soon, you will have a guy running after you, offering you some great prices.
The trick lies in guessing when to stop, you press a little too hard and you might just end up losing the chance to buy something good.
This will be an experience in itself!!!
