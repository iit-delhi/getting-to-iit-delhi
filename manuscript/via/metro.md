## Via Metro {#metro}

Ever since the introduction of the Metro Rail by DMRC, life has become so much simpler. With a direct line from the Railway Station/Airport to the Hauz Khas Station, this will be the beginning of many long metro journeys for you over the next four-five years. Cheap, fast, clean and convenient -- the Metro offers everything a commuter can dream of. For those unfamiliar with this form of transport, the Metro Rail, simply referred to as the "Metro", consists of a series of electrically-run super-fast trains, much like the Underground in London or U-Bahn/S-Bahn in Germany.

These trains operate on a number of different lines, usually denoted by different colours -- Yellow, Purple, Blue, Orange etc. Each line consists of a number of different stations and do not run parallel to the roads above ground. Lines usually intersect at major intersections or localities such as NDLS or Connaught Place. If you've never travelled on a Metro before, carpe diem! Riding in these trains is a pleasure, with automatic-doors and fully air-conditioned coaches they are magnificent. The cost of travel usually starts at about &#8377; 8, though the Metro smart card can give you a 10% discount. They require a first time payment of &#8377; 150 plus subsequent recharges of the card all of which have to be of minimum &#8377; 200.  
Taking large bags with you should not be a problem. The first coach of every train is reserved for ladies. Even in other coaches, there are seats reserved for senior citizens, the physically challenged and ladies.

A few tips regarding directions now --

The Metro station nearest to IIT Delhi is Hauz Khas on the Yellow Line. It is about a kilometer from IIT Main/Hostel Gate.

 - If coming from NDLS, take the Yellow Line from the underground New Delhi metro station, directed towards Qutab Minar or HUDA City Center. Get off nine stations later at Hauz Khas Metro Station.

 - If coming from the Airport, you may take the Metro directly from the underground station IGI Airport. This station is on the Orange Line. The Metro from IGIA is a super-fast train called the Delhi Airport Metro Express (DAME). It includes spaces for keeping luggage and will get you to New Delhi metro station. DAME runs at an avergae speed of 135 km/h opposed to an average of 80 km/h for most metros. The cost of the ride is Rs 80, cheaper than most alternative ways to reach from the airport. Get off at New Delhi, and take the Yellow Line till Hauz Khas.

**Our suggestion**: If reaching Delhi during a peak hour, such as morning (8-10 A.M.) or evening (5-7 P.M.), you should avoid traveling by Metro when carrying heavy luggage. While your large bags may clear Security, it can be difficult navigating them through a sea of wandering humans. Use may an Auto/Taxi during these hours. At all other times, the Metro is your best bet. The Metro does not run from 11 PM to 6 AM, so avoid reaching Delhi during this time frame.

**Important Note**: Exit from Hauz Khas Metro gate 2. Autos will be readily available, but to catch a bus, you will have to walk a few steps in the direction you exited, and cross the road via subway to reach the bus stop.
