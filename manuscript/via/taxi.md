## Via Taxi

A very convenient, though not-so pocket-friendly way of commuting is to take a taxi, although they can be a bit harder to find than, say, a Metro station or a Bus stand. However, if coming from any of the Railway Stations/Airports, there are plenty of taxis available for hire. You would mostly find a pre-paid Taxi counter at the station/airport(s) exit. You may also hire Radio Taxi readily available -- a simple call away. Google "Radio taxis in Delhi" for more info.
A few leading radio taxi operators' numbers:

Meru Cabs: 91-11-44224422 
Delhi Cab: 91-11-44333222
Easy Cab: 91-11-43434343
Quick Cabs: 91-11-45333333
Mega cab: 91-11-41414141

**Our suggestion**: Unless you have a LOT of luggage (including parents' luggage), prefer the Metro/Auto over this. If the high price is not a factor, then this can be your most comfortable option.
The charges for the taxis usually are - &#8377; 25 for the first Km and &#8377; 14(Non AC) / &#8377; 16 (AC) for next every Km. These are general prices and may vary from one Taxi Provider to another.
